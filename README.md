## What is this?

This is an interactive tool that predicts how much of each product a store will sell in the future. It has a fun retro gaming look, like classic video games from the 1980s and 1990s.

## What does it do?

The Retail Demand Forecaster helps retail businesses:

1. Look at past sales data to spot patterns
2. Predict future sales for specific products in specific stores
3. See how things like promotions, holidays, and out-of-stock events affect sales
4. Compare different forecasting methods to find what works best
5. Visualize data in colorful, easy-to-understand charts

## How will this help "In the Memory" in 2025?

As a retailer in 2025, "In the Memory" faces many challenges:

- **Reduce waste**: By knowing exactly how much product will sell, you can order just the right amount - not too much (which causes waste) and not too little (which leads to empty shelves).

- **Better staff planning**: When you know which days will be busy, you can schedule the right number of employees to help customers.

- **Smarter promotions**: The tool shows how promotions affect sales, so you can run them when they'll have the biggest impact.

- **Improved inventory management**: With accurate forecasts, you can keep your warehouse costs down while making sure popular products stay in stock.

- **Data-driven decisions**: Instead of guessing what might sell, store managers can use real predictions based on actual data.

- **Quick adaptation**: As shopping patterns change in 2025, the forecasting models will learn and adjust to keep predictions accurate.

## Key Technical Features
